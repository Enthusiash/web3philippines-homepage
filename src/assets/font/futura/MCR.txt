Here are the key components:

Examples of these channels include face-to-face interactions, phone calls, emails, social media platforms, and website chat support.

A3. Providing exceptional customer service relies heavily on frontline staff, who serve as the primary point of contact for customers. Equipping these staff members with the necessary skills, resources, and support is paramount to resolving customer issues and creating a positive experience.
